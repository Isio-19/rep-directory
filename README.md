## IA projects

A [natual language processing](https://github.com/Isio-19/TraitementAutomatique) project which: 

- classifies a tweet in 3 categories, weither it's positive, negative or neutral and generate SVM files;
- using the files generated in the previous part, trains a model (MLP) to predict the sentiment of a tweet using PyTorch;
- using the word2vec tool made by Google, find the similarity between 2 words and the most similar words for a given word.

A [protein structure prediction](https://github.com/Isio-19/approches_neuronales/tree/main/Esteve/TP1) model using either an MLP layer or a GRU layer using PyTorch.

Attempt at finding the best hyperparameters for the MLP model.

A [Ground Water Level](https://github.com/Isio-19/application-ia) model used to predict the GWL of underground water reserves depending the multiple variables.

The model uses a LSTM layer with the PyTorch library. 

Various experiments has been made on the model, such as fine-tuning the model on water wells from certain regions or simply fine-tuning the model of certain water wells.

A [sonar scan classifier](https://github.com/Isio-19/approches_neuronales/tree/main/Torres) model that predicts weither a underwater sonar scan is a scan of a rock formation or a metal cylinder. 

Uses the [Connectionist Bench dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/151/connectionist+bench+sonar+mines+vs+rocks).

## Python projects

[Minesweeper](https://github.com/Isio-19/Minesweeper/)

A minesweeper implementation with a GUI. 

Using TKinter and recursive functions. 

[CliMeteo](https://github.com/maximejullien2/CLIMeteo)

An application to display weather information in the terminal. 

Using OpenWeatherMap's API, rich for the terminal interface and made using Agile method.

[Lemmings-like](https://github.com/r-romettino/24h-pour-coder) game made during the first edition of a Game Jam like event (24h pour coder) organised by the University of Avignon. 

The project uses the Pygame library for the GUI, as well as classes (OOP).

## C++ projects

[File (de)compressor](https://github.com/Isio-19/de-compressor/)

A file compressor, using Huffman coding to compress and decompress a file.

[MacMahon tiles](https://github.com/Isio-19/MacMahon/)

An executable to solve Mac Mahon tiles sets.

Made using threads, different parallelisation processes (thread pool, for loop) and SDL2 for the GUI.

[Quixo tabletop game](https://github.com/Isio-19/Quixo/)

An implementation of the Quixo tabletop game. 

Made using the MVC design pattern, as well as SFML for the GUI.

## Java projects

[Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/Isio-19/TicTacToe/)

A game of Tic Tac Toe.

Using JavaFX for the user interface and an AI-controller player 2 for single player games.

[Map visualisation](https://gitlab.com/ceri-projet-programmation-2022/S2-Groupe_6)

An application not disimilar to Google Maps.

Made using the OpenWeatherMap's API, JavaFX and Speechbrain.

[Calendar](https://github.com/Isio-19/edt/)

A calendar application.

Using the University of Avignon's ICS API to fetch a time table, biweekly to parse the ICS file and JavaFX for the user interface.

## Other projects

[Custom keyboard project](https://github.com/Isio-19/Keyboard-Project/)

A custom keyboard project, split left-shift and ANSI enter. 

Using KiCad 8 for the schematic and PCB design, ebastler's marbastlib for the various switch and stabilisers' symbols and footprints.

Work in progress.

[Infographic course](https://github.com/Isio-19/INF5071/)

Work done in the INF5071 course while studying abroad in UQÃ M.

Uses the GlSim.js library.
